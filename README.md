### fcc lessons

The fcc lessons were challenging but extremely helpful at the same time. All though they helped me a ton, I still had trouble with nested arrays. Nested arrays are arrays stored inside another array.

```js

var array = [x,x,x
  [o,o,o]
  ];

```

In order to access the o's in the array you have to do ...

```js
array [1][0];
```

This confused me because I was not sure what the first number and second number meant. After watching Mr. Mueller go over it in class, and asked a couple of questions, I understood how it worked. Now I know that the first number is the element you want to grab in the row, and the second is the number you want to grab in the column.

### Push ,Pop, Shift, and Unshift

These statements all either remove or add a element to an array. Pop() removes the last element of an array. push() adds an element to the end of an array. shift() removes the first element. unshift() adds an element to the beginning of the array. These kind of confused me because it was hard to remember but I studied them and eventually I remembered them.

### takeaways

Learning arrays was challenging but fun. I know that arrays will be useful in my freedom project and other projects along the way this school year. I will make sure to use arrays consistently in order to not forget how to use them.
