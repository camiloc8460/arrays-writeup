### fcc lessons

The fcc lessons were challenging but extremely helpful at the same time. All though they helped me a ton, I still had trouble with nested arrays. Nested arrays are arrays stored inside another array.

```js

var array = [x,x,x
  [o,o,o]
  ];

```

In order to access the o's in the array you have to do ...

```js
array [1][0];
```
